.SH NAME
.B _printf
- Formatted output conversion.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "holberton.h"

.SH NAME
_printf() - takes input and prints to standard output.

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "holberton.h"

.SH Sintaxis
int _printf(const char *format, ...)

.SH format
This is the string that contains the text to be written to stdout. 
#include <stdarg.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function _printf() sends formatted output to stdout and uses format
specifiers to convert arguments into strings. The format specifiers are:
FORMAT outputs a specified format relative to the specifier input.

.SH Return Value
_printf() function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, then the resulting character is written
.TP
.B s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to a terminating null byte, but do ot include the terminating null byte.
.TP
.B S
Prints a string. Non printable characters are printed as "\x" followed by their ASCII values in two digit hexadecimal
.TP
.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B x, X
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned lowercase hexadecimal notation(x), or unsigned uppercase hexadecimal notation(X).
.TP
.B u
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned decimal notation
.TP
.B o, b
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal notation(o) or binary notation(b).
.TP
.B p
Address is printed in hexadecimal.
.TP
.B r
Prints a string in reverse.
.TP
.B R
Prints a string converted to rot13
.TP
.B %
A '%' is written but no argument is converted. The complete version specification is '%%'
.SH EXAMPLE
Many countries use the day-month-year order.  Hence, an
internationalized version must be able to print the arguments in
an order specified by the format:

#include <stdio.h>
printf(stdout, format,
weekday, month, day, hour, min);

where format depends on locale, and may permute the arguments.
With the value:

"%1$s, %3$d. %2$s, %4$d:%5$.2d\n"

one might obtain "Sonntag, 3. Juli, 10:02".
